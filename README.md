## Overview
As the elderly population grows, many seniors face challenges in managing their health independently due to memory issues, mobility limitations, and difficulty using technology. This can lead to missed medications, poor nutrition, and unmonitored health conditions. Existing healthcare solutions often lack user-friendly interfaces or personalized support, making it difficult for seniors to stay on top of their health needs without constant caregiver involvement. There is a need for an easy-to-use mobile solution that empowers seniors to manage their health independently.
