# MediMate

## Problem Statement
As the elderly population grows, many seniors face challenges in managing their health independently due to memory issues, mobility limitations, and difficulty using technology. This can lead to missed medications, poor nutrition, and unmonitored health conditions. Existing healthcare solutions often lack user-friendly interfaces or personalized support, making it difficult for seniors to stay on top of their health needs without constant caregiver involvement. There is a need for an easy-to-use mobile solution that empowers seniors to manage their health independently.

## Solution
MediMate is an easy-to-use app that helps seniors manage their health independently. It sends medication alerts and reminders and lets users navigate the app hands-free with voice commands. With its simple design, MediMate makes it easier for seniors to stay on top of their health without always needing help from a caregiver

## Design
MediMate is designed to be simple and easy for seniors to use. With large buttons, clear text, and an intuitive layout, it helps users manage their health without any hassle.
